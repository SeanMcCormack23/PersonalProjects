        <h2> A Brief History Lesson</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Bob Ross, name Robert Norman Ross, (born October 29, 1942, Daytona Beach, Florida, U.S.</li>
        <li>Ross enlisted at age 18 in the United States Air Force. While stationed in Alaska, he took his first painting class at a United Service Organizations club in the early 1960s.</li>
        <li>He learned the technique that would make his career, "the wet-on-wet" (alla prima) oil painting technique from TV painter Bill Alexander.</li>
        <li>Ross projected a loveable hippie persona, sporting a permed afro and denim shirts and jeans and a soothing and intimate speaking voice that made the viewer feel as if it were a personal, one-on-one painting lesson.</li>
        <li>Died July 4, 1995.</li>
        </ul>
